      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Cook the potatoes by boiling or baking them.</li>
        <li>
          Mash the potatoes in a large bowl using a potato masher or a fork.
        </li>
        <li>Add the eggs to the potatoes and mix well.</li>
        <li>
          Add in salt, pepper, turmeric, bloomed saffron and dried mint. Stir
          well to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in the flour, one tablespoon at a time. Mix after each addition.
        </li>
        <li>
          The mixture should be thick enough to be handled but not doughy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the vegetable oil in a non stick pan over medium heat. You'll
          know the oil is hot enough if you hold a toothpick in the oil and
          bubbles start appearing around it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shape the patties and fry them in the hot oil in batches. Fry for
          about 3 to 5 minutes on each side until crispy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place fried potato cakes on a kitchen towel to absorb their excess
          oil.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <!--Tips/Note section-->

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If russet potatoes are not available, you can use yukon gold potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>You can either bake or boil the potatoes to make these patties:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Boil potatoes:</strong>
            Peel the potatoes and cut each of them into half. Place them in a
            pot and enough water to cover them. Add a generous pinch of salt and
            bring it to boil. Let the potatoes boil for about 25 to 35 minutes
            until fully cooked. You know a potato is fully cooked when you can
            insert a knife into it without any resistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bake potatoes:</strong>
            To do so, preheat the oven to 425°F. Scrub the potatoes so the skin
            is completely clean. Prick all over the potatoes using a fork and
            brush with a bit of olive oil and sprinkle some salt on them. Wrap
            each potato in a piece of aluminum foil and place them on a baking
            sheet. Bake in the oven for about 45 to 60 minutes depending on the
            size of the potatoes. Once you can easily insert a knife into the
            potatoes, they’re baked completely.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bloomed saffron is an optional ingredient in this recipe. Please check
          out our tutorial on how to bloom saffron for more information about
          saffron and how to use it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dried mint makes these patties really delicious so don’t skip it if
          possible. Please don’t use fresh mint instead of dried in this recipe
          as the flavor and texture won’t be the same. Nutrition
